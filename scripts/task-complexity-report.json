      "reasoning": "The task involves multiple distinct UI sections with varied functionality, responsive design requirements, performance optimizations like lazy loading, and reusable component creation. This breadth and integration complexity justify a high complexity score and a detailed breakdown into subtasks for focused development and testing."
